This repository holds the code that runs the animation for the Rouge One fic of the same name.

You can find the fic on the [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/works/26006056). 


## I just want to run the animation and don't care about code.

Great! Your first option is to view the hosted site [here](https://justoakleaf.github.io/kay2-has-entered-chat/index.html).

Otherwise, look for the green "code" or "download" button. Select the "Download ZIP" option. On your computer, unzip this file, open up the `docs` folder and open the file called `index.html` in your browser.

## I want to read the source code.

You can clone the project and then view the files inside `docs`. There are no external dependencies.

Files in the `helper-scripts` directory are helpers to assist in creating the html file. They are stored here for the developer's benefit.

After cloning/downloading, open `docs/index.html` in your browser to view the animation.
