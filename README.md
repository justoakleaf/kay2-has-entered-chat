This repository holds the code that runs the animation for the Rouge One fic of the same name.

You can find the fic on the [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/works/26006056). 


## I just want to run the animation and don't care about code.

Great! Your first option is to view the hosted site [here](https://justoakleaf.github.io/kay2-has-entered-chat/web-src/k2.html).

Otherwise, look for the green "code" or "download" button. Select the "Download ZIP" option. On your computer, unzip this file, open up the `web-src` folder and open the file called `k2.html` in your browser.

## I want to read the source code.

You can clone the project and then view the files inside `web-src`. There are no external dependencies.

Files in the `helper-scripts` directory are helpers to assist in creating the html file. They are stored here for the developer's benefit.

Open `web-src/h2.html` in your browser to view the animation.
